PasswordManager is a basic application, which enables the user to store all their passwords in one central location. 
I was given this task as a test, however to define and develop my skill to professional standards, I have expanded 
this into a project.  The task is outlined below, with also a list of sites that I’ve used which will be updated 
as I go along.

Password Manager
The brief
We would like you to create a small application for users to manage their passwords.
This application must be written using PHP and MySQL.
Requirements
1) A user should be able to authenticate
a) Login, and
b) Logout
2) A logged in user should be able to:
a) Create a new entry
b) See a list of all their individual entries
c) View and update their entry
d) Delete their individual entries
Deliverables
* Provide all files required by your application in order for it to work.
* Include a README file with setup and configuration instructions.
Notes
* Please don’t use any 3rd-party PHP libraries/frameworks
* Javascript libraries/frameworks like jQuery are fine
